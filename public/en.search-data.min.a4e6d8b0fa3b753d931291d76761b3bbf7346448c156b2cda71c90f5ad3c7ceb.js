The base system uses eight keys in a 2x4 layout. The system is designed to be easy to learn, comfortable to use, and fast enough for practical use. The thumb is not needed for basic use and is free to stabilize and hold the board. This simplifies hardware design.\nApplication\r#\r\rARTSEY is not intended for any particular application. It may be of use both to non-diabled people and people with disabilities. Depending on the hardware, it may be used at a desk, or while mobile. It can be used on either the left or right hand.\nLayout\r#\r\rA graphic of the current version of the system can be found here:\nARTSEY.io Layout Diagram\nThis Site\r#\r\rThis site provides documentation about the ARTSEY system. The blog will track development and announce releases of firmware and hardware using the system.\nCommunity\r#\r\rFor more info and to get-in-touch:\nJoin our community on discord!\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/posts/alpha_combos/','title':"The Alpha Combos",'section':"Blog",'content':"Memorizing the Alpha Combos\r#\r\rMemorizing the alpha combos may seem difficult. It is easier to learn the letters in groups. There are patterns that will help with this:\nNotice the relationship between the first B chord option and C. They are only one key different and the B chord looks a little like a b when viewed from the side. Note that the second B chord is a little easier to hit so you may want to migrate to using that chord once you have everything memorized.\nB\n□□□□\n■■□■\nor\n□□□□\n■□□■\nC\n□□□□\n■■□□\nD, F, and G are alphabetically close together and all very similar. The F looks like the top of a captial F and the D looks like the back of a captial D.\nD\n■■■□\n□□□□\nF\n■■□□\n□□□□\nG\n□■■□\n□□□□\nNotice the relationship between H and I.

The relationship between M and N is especially easy to memorize. The L is just the M chord moveed over by one key and the K chord just removes one key from the M chord.\nK\n□□□□\n□■□■\nL\n□□□□\n■■■□\nM\n□□□□\n□■■■\nN\n□□□□\n□□■■\nP, and Q are the same chord but on differnt rows.
