The system is designed to be easy to learn, comfortable to use, and fast enough for practical use. Since only four fingers are used, the thumb is free to stabilize and hold the board. This simplifies hardware design.\nApplication\r#\r\rI developed ARTSEY to take notes while I walk. I hope other users will find it useful for applications where a standard keyboard is impossible or impractical.\nLayout\r#\r\rMost of the functionality of a full-size keyboard has already been implemented. A graphic of the current version of the system can be found here:\nARTSEY.io Layout Diagram\nThis Site\r#\r\rThis blog will keep track of ARTSEY development and announce releases of firmware and hardware using the system.\nCommunity\r#\r\rFor more info and to get-in-touch:\nJoin our community on discord!\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/posts/alpha_combos/','title':"The Alpha Combos",'section':"Blog",'content':"Memorizing the Alpha Combos\r#\r\rMemorizing the alpha combos may seem difficult. It is easier to learn the letters in groups. There are patterns that will help with this:\nNotice the relationship between the first B chord option and C. They are only one key different and the B chord looks a little like a b when viewed from the side. Note that the second B chord is a little easier to hit so you may want to migrate to using that chord once you have everything memorized.\nB\n□□□□\n■■□■\nor\n□□□□\n■□□■\nC\n□□□□\n■■□□\nD, F, and G are alphabetically close together and all very similar. The F looks like the top of a captial F and the D looks like the back of a captial D.\nD\n■■■□\n□□□□\nF\n■■□□\n□□□□\nG\n□■■□\n□□□□\nNotice the relationship between H and I.

The relationship between M and N is especially easy to memorize. The L is just the M chord moveed over by one key and the K chord just removes one key from the M chord.\nK\n□□□□\n□■□■\nL\n□□□□\n■■■□\nM\n□□□□\n□■■■\nN\n□□□□\n□□■■\nP, and Q are the same chord but on differnt rows.
