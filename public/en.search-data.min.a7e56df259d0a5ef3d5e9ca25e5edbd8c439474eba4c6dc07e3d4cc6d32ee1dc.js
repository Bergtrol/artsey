It is easier to learn the letters in groups. There are patterns that will help with this:\nNotice the relationship between the first B chord option and C. They are only one key different and the B chord looks a little like a b when viewed from the side. Note that the second B chord is a little easier to hit so you may want to migrate to using that chord once you have everything memorized.\nB\n□□□□\n■■□■\nor\n□□□□\n■□□■\nC\n□□□□\n■■□□\nD, F, and G are alphabetically close together and all very similar.
