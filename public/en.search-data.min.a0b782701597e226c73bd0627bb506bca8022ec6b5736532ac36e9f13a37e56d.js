The layout has reached a relatively mature state and I am now beginning to design dedicated hardware.\nWe have a handful of users who have reached 20 WPM on ARTSEY, and the discord server (see link below) is more active every day with discussion of ARTSEY and other experimental typing methods. I am personally up to nearly 50 WPM max and can easily sustain 40 WPM without extreme focus.\nI am looking forward to getting ARTSEY in the hands (hand) of more users in 2021!\nCommunity\r#\r\rFor more info and to get-in-touch:\nJoin our community on discord!\n"});index.add({'id':3,'href':'/posts/alpha_combos/','title':"The Alpha Combos",'section':"Blog",'content':"Memorizing the Alpha Combos\r#\r\rMemorizing the alpha combos may seem difficult. It is easier to learn the letters in groups. There are patterns that will help with this:\nNotice the relationship between the first B chord option and C. They are only one key different and the B chord looks a little like a b when viewed from the side. Note that the second B chord is a little easier to hit so you may want to migrate to using that chord once you have everything memorized.\nB\n□□□□\n■■□■\nor\n□□□□\n■□□■\nC\n□□□□\n■■□□\nD, F, and G are alphabetically close together and all very similar.

The main goal was getting common letters on the base keys. The secondary goal was to provide a memorable name for the system that could also serve as the URL.\nUsing the excellent analysis by Peter Norvig as a starting point, I decided A,E,I,O, and T had to be on base keys with some of H,N,R,S as well.\nIO stood out as a suitable URL suffix. Actual word prefixes like EARTHS, HEARTS, STERNA, ANTRES (thanks scrabble cheating helper website) were either too ordinary or not catchy. I wanted something unique and easy to remember. From here, I tried adding a few less-common letters. ARTSEY.IO rose to the top quickly.\nWhy Y?\r#\r\rY is not a particularly common letter in English. However, since 18 letters had to be chorded anyway, I thought putting it on base was a reasonable compromise to have a memorable name and URL that would help new users memorize the base letters instantly.\nAnalysis\r#\r\rBased on the Norvig analysis, with ARTSEYIO on the base layer, over 60% of typing (in English) occurs on non-chorded keys.\nFor more info and to get-in-touch:\nJoin our community on discord!\n"});})();
