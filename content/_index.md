# Introducing ARTSEY

ARTSEY.io (ARTSEY for short) is a one-handed typing system that mimics the functionality of a full-sized keyboard. The base system uses eight keys in a 2x4 layout. The system is designed to be easy to learn, comfortable to use, and fast enough for practical use. The thumb is not needed for basic use and is free to stabilize and hold the board. This simplifies hardware design.  

## Application
ARTSEY is not intended for any particular application. It may be of use both to non-diabled people and people with disabilities. Depending on the hardware, it may be used at a desk, or while mobile. It can be used on either the left or right hand. 

## Layout
A graphic of the current version of the system can be found here:

## This Site
This site provides documentation about the ARTSEY system. The blog will track development and announce releases of firmware and hardware using the system.
