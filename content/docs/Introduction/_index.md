# Introducing ARTSEY.io

ARTSEY.io (ARTSEY for short) is a one-handed typing system that uses eight keys in a 2x4 layout. The system is designed to be easy to learn, comfortable to use, and fast enough for practical use. Since only four fingers are used, the thumb is free to stabilize and hold the board. This simplifies hardware design.

## Application
I developed ARTSEY to take notes while I walk. I hope other users will find it useful for applications where a standard keyboard is impossible or impractical. 

## Layout
Most of the functionality of a full-size keyboard has already been implemented. A graphic of the current version of the system can be found here:

## This Site
This blog will keep track of ARTSEY development and announce releases of firmware and hardware using the system.
