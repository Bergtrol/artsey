# Choosing the Base Letters

![ARTSEY LOGO](/_FILES/images/logo.png)

The first task in designing the system was choosing the base letters. The main goal was getting common letters on the base keys. The secondary goal was to provide a memorable name for the system that could also serve as the URL. 

Using the excellent analysis by [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/mayzner.html) as a starting point, I decided A,E,I,O, and T had to be on base keys with some of H,N,R,S as well.    

IO stood out as a suitable URL suffix. Actual word prefixes like EARTHS, HEARTS, STERNA, ANTRES (thanks scrabble ~~cheating~~ helper website) were either too ordinary or not catchy. I wanted something unique and easy to remember. From here, I tried adding a few less-common letters. ARTSEY.IO rose to the top quickly.
## Why Y? 
Y is not a particularly common letter in English. However, since 18 letters had to be chorded anyway, I thought putting it on base was a reasonable compromise to have a memorable name and URL that would help new users memorize the base letters instantly.
## Analysis
Based on the Norvig analysis, with ARTSEYIO on the base layer, over 60% of typing (in English) occurs on non-chorded keys.
