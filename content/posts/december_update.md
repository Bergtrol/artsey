# December Update. 

Development of ARTSEY is continuing. The layout has reached a relatively mature state and I am now beginning to design dedicated hardware.  

We have a handful of users who have reached 20 WPM on ARTSEY, and the discord server (see link below) is more active every day with discussion of ARTSEY and other experimental typing methods. I am personally up to nearly 50 WPM max and can easily sustain 40 WPM without extreme focus.  

I am looking forward to getting ARTSEY in the hands (hand) of more users in 2021!
