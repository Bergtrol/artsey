# Memorizing the Alpha Combos

Memorizing the alpha combos may seem difficult. It is easier to learn the letters in groups. There are patterns that will help with this:

Notice the relationship between the first **B** chord option and **C**. They are only one key different and the B chord looks a little like a b when viewed from the side. Note that the second B chord is a little easier to hit so you may want to migrate to using that chord once you have everything memorized.   

**B**  
□□□□  
■■□■  
*or*  
□□□□  
■□□■  
**C**  
□□□□  
■■□□  

**D**, **F**, and **G** are alphabetically close together and all very similar. The **F** looks like the top of a captial F and the **D** looks like the back of a captial D.    

**D**  
■■■□  
□□□□  
**F**  
■■□□  
□□□□  
**G**  
□■■□  
□□□□  

Notice the relationship between **H** and **I**. Just remember "hi!" Plus, the H looks like the top of a captial H.    

**H**  
□□□□  
■□■□  
**I**  
□□□□  
□□■□  

**J** stands alone but the chord looks like the top of a J.   

**J**  
□□■■  
□□□□  

**K**, **L**, **M**, **N** are all on the bottom row. The relationship between **M** and **N** is especially easy to memorize. The **L** is just the **M** chord moveed over by one key and the **K** chord just removes one key from the **M** chord. 

**K**  
□□□□  
□■□■  
**L**  
□□□□  
■■■□  
**M**  
□□□□  
□■■■  
**N**  
□□□□  
□□■■  

**P**, and **Q** are the same chord but on differnt rows. Plus, they look a bit like the lower-case version of the letter. 

**P**  
□□□□  
■□■■  
**Q**  
■□■■  
□□□□  

**U** and **V** both look a little like the letter, but the **V** is just spread-out by one key.   

**U**  
□□□□  
□■■□  
**V**  
□■□■  
□□□□  

For **W**, draw a W with your hand.  

**W**  
■□□■  
□□□□  

**X**, and **Z** are both on the top row and among the most difficult chords.   

**X**  
□■■■  
□□□□  
**Z**  
■■■■  
□□□□
